# Arrow Gaem
A 4k rhythm game that uses Beat Saber V2 and V3 maps as a mapping format (yes really). I'm linking this here in case the project servers at PM go down.

## Note
The HTML file in the main directory are stable builds. While the one in `dev` is bleeding edge

## Controls
- ### Gameplay
- Arrow keys to hit arrows (can be changed later)
- Q to pause
- ### Map importing
- 9 to import a map from BeatSaver.com via a bsr key
- 8 to import a map from zip
- ### Miscellaneous
- Space + S to take a game screenshot (won't capture HUD text)
