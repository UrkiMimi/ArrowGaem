# Arrow Gaem
A 4k rhythm game that uses Beat Saber V2 and V3 maps as a mapping format (yes really). I'm linking this here in case the project servers at PM go down.

## Note
The HTML files listed here are stable builds, while the PMP file itself are bleeding edge.

## Controls
- ### Gameplay
- Arrow keys to hit arrows (can be changed later)
- Q to pause
- ### Settings
- I + O + Space to set offset
- I + O + Del/BkSpace to reset offset
- ### Map importing
- 9 to import a map from BeatSaver.com via a bsr key
- 8 to import a map from zip
- ### Miscellaneous
- Space + S to take a game screenshot (won't capture HUD text)
