# ArrowGaem [Archived]
A 4k rhythm game that uses Beat Saber V2 and V3 maps as a mapping format (yes really). I'm linking this here in case the project servers at PM go down. 

## *Notice*
- **This game is no longer actively maintained, hence the archive of the repository. Anyone is free to make a fork of this game however I will not be updating it anymore. I may revisit this game but I'll fully rewrite the whole engine inside of a different game engine/programming language. PenguinMod/Scratch is too painful to use as a proper game engine and some shader effects are down right impossible.**

# Dev note
- The HTML file in the main directory are stable builds. While the one in `dev` is bleeding edge

## Controls
- ### Gameplay
- Arrow keys to hit arrows (can be changed later)
- Q to pause
- ### Map importing
- 9 to import a map from BeatSaver.com via a bsr key
- 8 to import a map from zip
- ### Miscellaneous
- Space + S to take a game screenshot (won't capture HUD text)
