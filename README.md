# Arrow Gaem
A 4k rhythm game that uses Beat Saber V2 and V3 maps as a mapping format (yes really). I'm linking this here in case the project servers at PM go down.

## Note
This game uses the Teko font family. While it's not required to play this game. Itâ€™s recommended to install the font on your system to have the best experience. (thanks pm for not allowing custom fonts to be imported)
The font itself can be obtained here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Teko
